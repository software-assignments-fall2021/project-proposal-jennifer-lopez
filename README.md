# foodwithfriends
##### Proposed By: Jennifer Lopez

### What and Why?
Are you going out to eat with friends anytime soon? These friendly gatherings usually go one of two ways: a restaurant is agreed upon fairly quickly *or* you spend 30+ minutes choosing what to eat in the first place (not including the actual restaurant you are going to).

`foodwithfriends` is a web application that aims to make decision-making for where to eat *easy*. Users can invite their entourage to a "room" where they can choose a cuisine they prefer (e.g. Italian, Chinese, etc.), vote on it, and go on to choose a restaurant together in a desired neighborhood or current location.

Instead of wasting time deciding on what and where to eat, `foodwithfriends` allows you and your friends to share a meal instantly.

### For Whom?
`foodwithfriends` is created with the intention to help out indecisive eaters or anyone who is planning a dinner with a group (who may comprise of "picky" eaters).

### How?

As a User, I can: 
- Create and invite friends to a group or "room" where our decision-making will happen. 
- Choose or randomize and then vote on a cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Mexican, etc.).
- Optionally add specific dishes I'm craving that are within the unanimously-chosen cuisine (e.g. Italian - chicken parmesan).
- Optionally add dietary restrictions (e.g. Vegan).
- Specify a specific neighborhood or use my current location to search restaurants from.
- Vote on a restaurant my group and I should go to in the end.

Essentially, the host user will collaboratively choose a restaurant with their friend group via questionaires and voting. The choices in cuisine, dishes (optional), dietary restrictions (optional), and location are used to generate a list of potential restaurants that *hopefully* meets all of the group members preferences.

### Scope
This project will comprise of having some familiarity with the MERN stack (or any other web technologies), using REST APIs (google maps, [Documenu](https://documenu.com/), etc.), and websockets to establish the communication among the group. Even for someone with no experience, there are a lot of resources available to help build the main components of this application within the course of the semester.
